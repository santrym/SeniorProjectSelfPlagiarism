# SeniorProjectSelfPlagiarism
My Self-Plagiarism app.

This is the code to my senior project. It is a Self-Plagiarism Application, in which one can choose to record 
the things they say and then have the abiliy to see if they have said a similar thing in the past. The idea behind
this comes from just hearing friends and family repeat themselves. I wanted to create something that would allow
individuals to know if what they are saying is a repeat of something they have already said in the past, thus, allowing
them to abort the particular idea or topic they are speaking of, or simply be aware that what they are saying now
has been said before in the past.
